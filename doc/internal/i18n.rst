Internationalization and localization
=====================================

Internationalization and localization of NextGIS Web is powered by `gettext`_
and `babel`_ libraries. The procedure for working with strings is standard for
projects based on gettext:

.. _gettext: http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext
.. _babel: http://babel.pocoo.org/

1. Extract strings to translate from sources to ``.pot`` file (``extract``)
2. Create or update ``.po`` files from ``.pot`` files (``update``)
3. Compile ``.po`` files into ``.mo`` files (``compile``)

All lines that are shown to the user must be written in sources in English and
only then translated into other languages.

Translation is performed for each component of NextGIS Web separately. As a
result, there is no way to internationalize strings that do not belong to any
component.

Translations of each component exist within its own ``domain`` in terms of the
gettext library. For a component a certain line can be translated in one way,
and in another - in another, even without the use of contexts.

All actions on translations are performed using ``nextgisweb-i18n`` command line
utility from the ``nextgisweb`` package. This utility is an add-on to the
``pybabel`` utility from ``babel`` package with default settings preset.

Let's consider localization to Russian on the example of ``bar`` component from
``nextgisweb_foo`` package. In this case, the directory structure will look like
this:

::

  🗁 nextgisweb_foo
  ├── 🗁 nextgisweb_foo
  │   └── 🗁 bar
  │       └── 🗀 locale
  └── 🗎 setup.py     

Extract strings from source code files with default settings:

::

  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo extract bar

This will create a ``.pot`` file ``nextgisweb_foo/bar/locale/.pot``. Since this
file can be generated at any time, there is no need to put it inside the source
control system.

Create a ``.po`` file for the Russian language based on the ``.pot`` file:

::

  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo update bar ru

As a result, the ``.po`` file ``nextgisweb_foo/bar/locale/ru.po`` will be
created. This file must be filled in accordance with the translation of the
strings in it using a text editor or a specialized ``.po`` file editor.

After this, we compile ``.po`` files into ``.mo`` files, which also do not need
to be placed in the version control system:

::

  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo compile bar

The resulting directory structure is given bellow. The files `bar.jed` are
analogous to the mo file for the javascript library `jed`_, which is used for
client-side internationalization. These files are also created at the
compilation stage.

.. _jed: http://slexaxton.github.io/Jed/

::

  🗁 nextgisweb_foo
  ├── 🗁 nextgisweb_foo
  │   └── 🗁 bar
  │       └── 🗁 locale
  │           ├── 🗎 .pot
  │           ├── 🗎 ru.mo
  │           └── 🗎 ru.po
  └── 🗎 setup.py

This completes the initial internationalization, after some time new lines may
have be added to the package, in this case you need to re-extract the lines,
automatically update the ``.po`` file, edit it and compile again:

::

  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo extract bar
  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo update bar
  (env) $ nano nextgisweb_foo/bar/locale/ru.po
  (env) $ nextgisweb-i18n --package nextgisweb_foo compile bar


Server side
-----------

Python code
^^^^^^^^^^^

To be able to extract strings for translation, they must be marked up
appropriately. Below is described how to do this, as well as how to ensure the
display of already translated strings to the user.

Since python code is executed on a server, the same application instance must be
able to serve users with different locales, it is necessary to use a two-step
work with strings: first, the string is marked as requiring translation, then
before displaying it to the user, it's translated according to the user's
preferences. 

The class :py:class:`nextgisweb.i18n.trstring.TrString` solves this problem,
which is similar to the class :py:class:`translationstring.TranslationString`,
but with some additional convenience in terms of string interpolation. Let's
look at the example of the ``bar`` component from the ``nextgisweb_foo``
package.

.. code-block:: text
  :caption: Sample directory structure
  :name: tree-server

  🗁 bar
  ├── 🗁 template
  │   └── 🗎 section.mako
  ├── 🗎 __init__.py
  └── 🗎 util.py
    
.. code-block:: python
  :caption: File util.py

  from nextgisweb.i18n import trstring_factory
  _ = trstring_factory('bar')

Function :py:func:`nextgisweb.i18n.trstring.trstring_factory` allows you to
simplify creation of strings :py:class:`~nextgisweb.i18n.trstring.TrString` with
a predefined domain, which is specified in the function parameters. For
convenience, both the function and the class are also available for import from
the module :py:mod:`nextgisweb.i18n`, as shown in the examples.

.. code-block:: python
  :caption: File __init__.py #1

  from .util import _
  def something():
      return _('Some message for translation')

Usage of the underscore character is necessary for extraction of translation
strings, so you can't import it with a different name ``from .util import _ as
blah``, it will break extraction process.

For string output in accordance with the user's preferences (one user may want
English, the other Russian), you need to translate the string using the
``request.localizer.translate(trstring)`` method:

.. code-block:: python
  :caption: File __init__.py #2

  @view_config(renderer='string')
  def view(request):
      return request.localizer.translate(something())

.. note::

  Since ``request`` only makes sense in the web application, this means that
  currently it isn't possible to use localization in the nextgisweb command line
  utilities.

Mako templates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of the strings that require translation are also contained in the
mako-templates. In fact, the work of mako templates is not much different from
the python code: first, we mark the string for translation with a special
function, then we need to translate through ``request``, taking into account the
user's preferences.

.. code-block:: mako
  :caption: File template/section.mako #1

  <% from nextgisweb_foo.bar.util import _ %>
  <div>${request.localizer.translate(_("Another message for translation"))}</div>

To shorten this long notation a bit, a ``tr()`` function has been added to the
mako-template's context, which does the same. The example below is completely
equivalent to the previous one:

.. code-block:: mako
  :caption: File template/section.mako #2

  <% from nextgisweb_foo.bar.util import _ %>
  <div>${tr(_("Another message for translation"))}</div>

.. note:: 

  Unfortunately, it isn't possible use this function as a modifier
  ``${expression | tr}``. In this case, the result of the standard modifier
  ``n``, that is ``markupsafe.Markup`` gets into the function.

In order to track that all strings requiring translation were translated when
outputting in the template in debug mode (setting ``debug`` of the component
``core``) a special modifier is added to the standard modifier ``n``, which
checks whether the translation was performed using ``request.localizer`` and if
not, then the corresponding warning is displayed in the log.

Client side
-----------

When executing client-side code, user preferences are already known and there is
no need for two-step processing. Translation and marking strings for translation
can be combined into one function. The `jed`_ library is used as `gettext`_
library implementation with ``.jed`` files precompiled from ``.po`` files on the
server side.

Modern JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider the following directory structure of ``bar`` component:

.. code-block:: text
  :caption: Directory structure

  🗁 bar
  └── 🗁 nodepkg
      └── 🗁 bar
          ├── 🗎 some-module.js
          └── 🗎 package.json

And here is the simple example, where string extraction and translation work:

.. code-block:: javascript
  :caption: File bar/nodepkg/bar/some-module.js

  import i18n from "@nextgisweb/pyramid/i18n!";
  
  const translated = i18n.gettext("Some message for translation");
  console.log("Localized message: " + translated);


Old-style JavaScript
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: text
  :caption: Directory structure

  🗁 bar
  └── 🗁 amd
      └── 🗁 ngw-bar
          ├── 🗎 mod-a.js
          ├── 🗎 mod-b.js
          └── 🗁 template
              └── 🗎 html.hbs

.. code-block:: javascript
  :caption: File amd/ngw-bar/mod-a.js

  define([
      "@nextgisweb/pyramid/i18n!"
  ], function (i18n) {
      var translated = i18n.gettext("Some message for translation");
      alert(translated);
  });

As a result of loading this module, a message will be displayed, translated in
exactly the same way as on the server. In this case client and server use the
same set of strings.

Handlebars
^^^^^^^^^^

Dijit-widgets often use template-based construction, which may also require
internationalization. To do this, it is possible to first pass the template
through the template engine `handlebars`_.

.. _handlebars: http://handlebarsjs.com/

.. code-block:: javascript
  :caption: File amd/ngw-bar/mod-b.js

  define([
      "@nextgisweb/pyramid/i18n!",
      "dojo/text!.template/html.hbs"
  ], function (i18n, template) {
      var translated = i18n.renderTemplate(template);
      alert(translated);
  });

.. code-block:: html
  :caption: amd/ngw-bar/html.hbs

  <strong>{{gettext "Another message for translation"}}</strong>

.. note::
    
  To extract strings from handlebars templates, you need to have nodejs
  installed. This allows you to use the original handlebars javascript parser to
  handle templates.

In case of a template-based widget, using handlebars for internationalization
would look like the original example in the dijit documentation:

.. code-block:: javascript

  define([
      "dojo/_base/declare",
      "dijit/_WidgetBase",
      "dijit/_TemplatedMixin",
      "@nextgisweb/pyramid/i18n!",
      "dojo/text!./template/SomeWidget.hbs"
  ], function(declare, _WidgetBase, _TemplatedMixin, i18n, template) {
      return declare([_WidgetBase, _TemplatedMixin], {
          templateString: i18n.renderTemplate(template)
      });
  });

.. note::

  According to the settings, specified in the babel.cfg file, widget templates
  should have the ``.hbs`` extension and be located inside ``template``
  directory.

Configuration options
---------------------

The default language is determined by the ``locale.default`` setting of the
``core`` component. English is used by default. Thus, in order for all messages
to be displayed in Russian in the ``config.ini``, you need to specify:

.. code-block:: ini

  [core]
  locale.default = ru
